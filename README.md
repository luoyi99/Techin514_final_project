## Part 1
### Jumping Jacks Counter
 A basic fitness tracker that monitors and displays key metrics like the number of jumps, rate (jumps per minute), heart rate and calories burned. The project integrates an accelerometer for motion sensing, a pulse sensor for heart rate monitoring, a display mechanism using screen and stepper motor-driven gauge needle, and a button for reset.

## Part 2 - Sensor Device
The sensor device will include a MPU6050 motion sensor, a pulse sensor, a ESP32S3 processor and a battery. The components will be sewed on a glove so users can wear it when doing jumping jacks without worrying it to fall down.

## Part 3 - Display Device
The display device will include a ESP32S3 processor, a battery, a OLED screen, a button, a LED, a stepper motor driver breakout board (Adafruit TB6612 1.2A DC/Stepper Motor Driver Breakout Board) and a stepper-motor-driven gauge needle (x27.168).
